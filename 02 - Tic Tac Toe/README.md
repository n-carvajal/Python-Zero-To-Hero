## Project 2: Tic Tac Toe

Two simple Tic Tac Toe programs. One of which is playable between two players
and the other is a single player version.

### Rules

The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a
3-by-3 grid.
To start a 3 by 3 board is drawn producing 9 empty squares.
Which player goes first and which player goes second is decided by a coin toss
at the start of the game.
The player to go first always plays 'X' and the player to go second plays 'O'.
Players alternate placing 'X's and 'O's on the board until either player has
three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Once a player is able to draw three X's or O's as above that player wins and
the game ends.
If all squares on the grid are filled and no player is able to draw three X's
or O's then the game is a draw.
